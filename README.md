Abduction-and-Kidnapping-analysis
======


This is an exploratory analysis of the dataset of abduction and kidnapping in India (2001-2010).
I found some useful things in the dataset like how many abduction and kidnapping happened in each and every state in India from 2001 to 2010.

By using bar graph I am showing the number of people is being kidnapped or abducted in the last 10 years.

From the other bar graph, I want to show that which states are having more crime against man and woman.
